# Week Report 2
## Summary of Presentations
Virtualization is the replication of hardware to simulate a virtual machine inside a physical one. Two types of virtualization are; server-side virtualization and client-side virtualization. Server-side virtualization provides a desktop to all users and client-side virtualization manages virtual machines. Some benefits of virtualization are, allowing multiple OSs run on one machine and allowing applications to be tested before installing them on a host machine. Type 1 hypervisor runs on hardware such as VMware ESX and ESXi. Type 2 hypervisor runs on a host operating system such as Oracle VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a very powerful type 2 virtualization product for enterprises and at home use.
