## Question 5
The EdUBudgie Linux is a version of Ubuntu Budgie Linux but instead it is pre-packaged with everything that a student might need to be successful. I don't think there is such thing as pre-packaged OS because it's probably faulty or not running correctly. Ubuntu Budgie Linux is the original package and original always works better. They want to make people get EdUBudgie instead because it has "additional packages installed and a few customizations pre-applied". EdUBudgie is probably going to stay pending for a little while longer, based on how they made Ubuntu Budgie Linux seem as unreliable.
